# Arduino-Robot-Project
This repo is to document and preserve the Arduino functions created for my robot dog, Spot. The original robot design and code was found at: https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Arduino-Powered-Quadruped-Robot/. Slight modifications were made to the design, and much has been changed in the code.
